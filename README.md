# Sales-and-Inventorty-Management-System

We are developing a Sales and Inventory Management System that features 
integration of sales, inventory control, purchase order, customer management,
report generation and office accounting. The Sales and Inventory Management system calculates the pricing markdowns
automatically as sales occurs.

This Sales and Inventory Management System is being developed by following Multitier Architecture
(a clientâ€“server architecture in which presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated)
using C#.NET Platform, Windows Presentation Foundation,
Visual Studion 2015 and Microsoft SQL Server 2014.
